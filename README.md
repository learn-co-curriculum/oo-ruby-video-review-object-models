# Video: Object Models

## Overview

This video gives an overview of object models and how to make our classes more powerful. 

## Objectives

- Create a class and add reader and writer methods
- Define class methods with an explicit `self` receiver
- Capture new instances of `self` in the `initialize` method 
- Use a class variable or constant to hold the instances of the class
- Explain why we avoid using the `return` keyword from within a loop
- Define a `find_by_location` method to find a particular instance of a class
- Abstract the logic of the `find_by_location` method to a `detect` enumerable method
- Define a class method `find_all_by_location` to find all instances with that location using the `select` enumerable method
- Define a custom constructor method to create instances from attributes scraped from a website
